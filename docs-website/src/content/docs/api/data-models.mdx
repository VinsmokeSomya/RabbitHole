This document provides a detailed reference for the core Pydantic data models that form the backbone of the RabbitHole Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol.

## Core Models

These are the most fundamental data structures you'll interact with.

<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Task" icon="document">
        The central object representing a job for an agent to perform. It contains the status, history, and artifacts.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Message" icon="message">
        A single user or agent message, which is composed of one or more `Part` objects.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Artifact" icon="attachment">
        Represents any data produced by an agent that is not a direct conversational response, like a file or a block of code.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

### `TaskState`
An `Enum` representing the life cycle of a task.

- `SUBMITTED`: The task has been received but is not yet being worked on.
- `WORKING`: The agent is actively processing the task.
- `INPUT_REQUIRED`: The agent requires additional input from the user to continue.
- `COMPLETED`: The task has finished successfully.
- `CANCELED`: The task was canceled by the user.
- `FAILED`: The task terminated with an error.
- `UNKNOWN`: The state of the task cannot be determined.

---

### `Part` Objects
A `Message` is made up of `parts`. Each part can be one of the following types:

#### `TextPart`
The most common part, representing a string of text.
- `type: "text"`
- `text: str`

#### `FilePart`
Represents a file. The file's content must be provided as either a URI or base64-encoded bytes.
- `type: "file"`
- `file: FileContent`
  - `name: str | None`
  - `mimeType: str | None`
  - `bytes: str | None`
  - `uri: str | None`

#### `DataPart`
A generic container for structured JSON data.
- `type: "data"`
- `data: dict[str, Any]`

---

### `Message`
A message sent between a user and an agent.
- `role: "user" | "agent"`: Who sent the message.
- `parts: List[Part]`: The content of the message.
- `metadata: dict | None`: Optional arbitrary metadata.

---

### `Task`
The main object that encapsulates a conversation and its state.
- `id: str`: A unique identifier for the task.
- `sessionId: str | None`: An identifier for a series of related tasks.
- `status: TaskStatus`: The current state of the task.
  - `state: TaskState`
  - `message: Message | None`
  - `timestamp: datetime`
- `artifacts: List[Artifact] | None`: A list of artifacts associated with the task.
- `history: List[Message] | None`: The full conversation history.
- `metadata: dict | None`: Optional arbitrary metadata.
